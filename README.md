Hi, I'm @TheSmallHill. I am mainly a C++ developer interested in the distributed systems problem space (microservices, scaling, orchestration, etc.). I'm
currently working on expanding my knowledge of algorithms and data structures. Through this I am also hoping to expand my skillset into new languages and
technologies. I am not currently looking to collaborate on anything in particular but am open to ideas while I work on my own skills and personal projects.
I can be reached via my LinkedIn page [here](www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-knoll-6315b585)
